## Questions and Answers
### How long will it be until development has started?
I cannot be sure of that to be honest. I'd say probably a year at least from the creation of this repository. If we need to spend a year on the design document, that is fine, but I'd like to keep the scope under control and not get too big. I'd expect it to be playable well before a 1.0 release (even if not fully complete).

### Will this game be completly free?
Yes, it will be free as in beer and free as in freedom. This game will be licensed under the GPL to make sure that it stays free (free beer and freedom).

### What engine will you be using?
That has not been decided as of yet. We could use Unity, Unreal, CryEngine or we could roll our own engine, the last option seems to be the most common for many open-source games and remakes (such as 0 A.D. and OpenMW).

### What language will be used?
That depends on what engine we decide to use. If we go down the Unity3D route, it'll be C#. If we go Unreal, C++. If we roll our own, that'll depend on the engine we design.

### Where did the name Scroll of Banestones come from?
That was a completely random name, god only knows where that name came from.
