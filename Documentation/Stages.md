# Project Stages

## Pre-production - In Progress
This is the stage where we define what the game will look like, write its main story and also write down the game design documment, technical specification document and other neccesary documents.

This is the stage where we also create the concept art for the game as well.

This is also the stage where we also start creating most of the 3D models that will be used in the game, such as weapons, shields, houses, rocks and props once we have completed the concept art for those models.

We should also create a basic prototype / proof of concept.

## Production - Not Started
This is the stage where we start production on the game itself including the engine (if we roll our own), and the game logic. We will also be able to add more models and art assets at this stage if needed, but we should preferably have most of them by now.

The game may be playable at some stage in this part of the development life-cycle but the game will not enter testing until all of the main quests, client side code and server side code has been completed.

## Testing - Not Started
This stage is where we will start to do hard testing of the game and bug-fixing. The game will not be at 1.0 but it will be considered playable with the main quests and server code completed by this stage.

## Release - Not Started
This stage is self explanitory, the game will be at 1.0 at this stage and we may also decide on a design document for future updates and other niceties.
