# Race Overview
## Celtic-Like
This is a race of humans who believe that world around them is sacred and is an embodiement of the gifts of that the gods bestowed on them, as such these race of men believe that the world should be treated with the utmost respect and that any activies which "hurt" the land such as chopping down trees, hunting and fishing should be proceeded by a ritual to the gods to "ask" for their permission.

These people as such, care greatly for the land including planting trees, keeping the land clean and trying to build their settlements where there is a clearing in a forest.

## Viking-Like
This is a race of humans who believe that to die in battle is the greatest honour that a person can ever achieve. They live in a mostly village life-style with many localfolk farming and when the call to battle is announced, drop their farming tools and grab the weapons of war. They also believe that those who would harm the innocent would also be doomed to burn for eternity in a state of constant pain. They are also an extremly charitable race of people who are always willing to lend a hand to those most in need such as the poor and the sick.

These people as such have great respect for war and dying in battle, but heavilly frown upon attacking the innocent. They also believe in charity and that charity can bring self-respect.

## Arab-like
This is a race of humans that believe that family is the most important aspect of life. They believe that starting a family should be a persons life goal and that starting a family will earn them a place in the after-life. They also tend to live in a more urbanised lifestyle in cities where they like to style their buildings to be beautiful and magestic.

As such, these people believe that family is important whilst also decorating their houses and cities.

## Roman-like
This is a race of humans that believe in the rule of law, they belive that the law should always be followed and that unjust laws should be fought in a courthouse instead of a battlefield. They also bring this law and order to the military by fielding organised legions that have proven to be capable in battle and often bring victories.

As such, they have respect for the Rule of Law and believe that order in their armies brings them victories.

## High-Elf
This is a race of elves that make heavy use of magic and use it to get through most of their lives. This can include floating houses, summing a sword and shield only when in battle. Their cities tend to be magestic and they make heavy use of enchanted glass in the building of their cities which only they know how to create.

As such, they use magic for everything including healing, war and construction which was resulted in great cities which are beautiful to look at.
