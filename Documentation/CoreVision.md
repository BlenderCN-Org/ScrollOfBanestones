## Our Vision
Scrolls of Banestones will be a 3D third person action RPG based in a fictional universe.  
It will take inspiration from franchises such as The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, Baldurs Gate, etc.

## Design Pillars
These are the main design pillars that the game will be designed around:
* Combat
* Exploration
* Looting
* Customisation

### Combat
Combat means that the game must have decent combat for a third person game, this means that the player should be able to fight in a third person environment whilst still being able to accuratly target their enemies or their friends, if they're feeling evil >:-).

But we should take great effort to ensure that the player does not unintentially attack those who they do not intend on attacking otherwise (NPC or other player).

### Exploration
Exploration means that the player should be able to explore the world around them in an open world envionment that is typical of many action RPGs. They should be able to travel between different towns, cities and into different area's, preferably with little to no loading screens (if possible).

### Looting
The player should be able to loot the bodies of their enemies, fallen comrades or loot the world of its items. This means that we will require an inventory system of some sort and also the world items they loot should have some way of seamlessly regenerating.

### Customisation
This means that the player should be able to customise the game through what ever means they wish. This also means that servers should also be able modify the game server-side such as custom models, sounds, scripts or other data.

## Heart and Soul
If you strip the game down to it's bare basics, it boils down to the story that the player wants to pursue in any given server with the rules and assets that are defined in that server.

The player will be reliant on using
* Traditional melee combat such as sword, fist, spear, axes or blunt weapons, or
* Ranged combat such as Bow, Throwing knives, Darts or Javelins, or
* Using magic that where the player can throw fire balls, spark balls, congure melee, ranged weapons or healing spells

They can also use a combination of the above as well if they wish.

The player will also need to loot the bodies of their enemies in order to gain better (or worse) equipment, more gold or overall find rare items.

The player can also run a server where they can define their own rules and own lore if they so wish.

The player will be able to take part as one of 10 humanoid races:
* Celtic-like
* Viking-like
* Arab-like
* Roman-like
* High Elf
* Snow Elf
* Dark Elf
* Wood Elf
* Dog-like
* Cat-like

Notes:
* These races will be available on all servers regardless of gamemode.  
* Servers may also be able to create their own races which will be exclusive to that server only. This will be discussed further in the design document.

## Game setting
This game may be set in a medieval-like world that will also take strong influences from modern society where appropriate (will be decided in design document).

The game world will be described in a `WorldBuild` folder inside of `(Root)/Documentation` where we will write all the lore, in-game books, main story, side quests and other world details.
