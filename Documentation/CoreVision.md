# Core Vision Document
**Version:** 0.2
**Last Updated:** 4th, August 2019.

## Our Vision
Scrolls of Banestones will be a 3D third person action RPG based in a fictional universe.  
It will take inspiration from franchises such as The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, Baldurs Gate, etc.

## Design Pillars
These are the main design pillars that the game will be designed around:
* Combat
* Exploration
* Looting
* Customisation

### Combat
Combat means that the game must have decent combat for a third person game, this means that the player should be able to fight in a third person environment whilst still being able to accuratly target their enemies or their friends, if they're feeling evil >:-).

But we should take great effort to ensure that the player does not unintentially attack those who they do not intend on attacking otherwise (NPC or other player).

### Exploration
Exploration means that the player should be able to explore the world around them in an open world envionment that is typical of many action RPGs. They should be able to travel between different towns, cities and into different area's, preferably with little to no loading screens (if possible).

### Looting
The player should be able to loot the bodies of their enemies, fallen comrades or loot the world of its items. This means that we will require an inventory system of some sort and also the world items they loot should have some way of seamlessly regenerating.

### Customisation
This means that the player should be able to customise the game through what ever means they wish. This also means that servers should also be able modify the game server-side such as custom models, sounds, scripts or other data.
