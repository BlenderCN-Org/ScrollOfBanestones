# Game Design Document
**Version:** 0.1  
**Last Updated:** 5th, August 2019.  

## General Overview

### Introduction

This game design document outlines the vision of the game as well as the more technical details that will define the direction we will be taking the game towards.

In this document we will design a game that will be free, open source software that will be released under a permissive license whilst the game assets will be released under a different license.

Our goal here is to create a 3D action RPG game set in a fictional world. This game will be based on a third person perspective (think of the camera in the 3D and HD Grand Theft Auto games)

### Platforms

The intended platforms will be the three main desktop platforms which are as follows:
* Windows
* macOS
* Linux

We do not at this moment in time have any intention of releasing to the mobile platforms (Android, iOS) or the console platforms (Xbox, PlayStation)

### Flowchart

### Unique Selling Points

### Build System

The build system for the game should probably be the open source oriented build system Travis CI. This build system works well for most projects and I see no reason why it should not work for us either.

I do believe that Travis CI is macOS & Linux only, we'll probably need a similar system that will support Windows.
